# **StoryOS**

# **Prototype**

**Version: 01**

# **OBJECTIVE**

**The StoryOS prototype will be a working proof of concept designed to validate the core architecture of the product. It demonstrates how story data, expression rules, and narrative logic can operate together to generate consistent, brand-aligned storytelling.**

The prototype includes five key system components: 

1. Unified Narrative Framework (UNF)  
2. Brand Voice  
3. Story Models  
4. Deliverable Templates  
5. Deliverables

It will test how content (Elements in the UNF) can be structured, combined, and expressed through reusable Deliverable Templates that apply both narrative models and Brand Voice filters at render time. The prototype will focus on two Deliverables—a Brand Manifesto and a Press Release—each using different Story Models and drawing from shared story data in the UNF.

The goal is not to produce finished marketing assets, but to prove that the system can manage relationships between data, structure, and style in a scalable way. Specifically, the prototype must show that:

1. Elements can be reused across Deliverables with proper version tracking  
2. Brand Voice can apply tone and style rules without altering source content  
3. Story Models and Deliverable Templates can structure narratives consistently  
4. Deliverables can record provenance for full traceability.  

If these functions perform as expected, the prototype will confirm that StoryOS can scale into a full platform for managing enterprise storytelling systems.

# **USER STORIES**

**1\. Create a Brand Manifesto from template**

As a Marketing Lead, I create a Brand Manifesto using the PAS Story Model so I can publish a one-page statement aligned with our Vision and Key Messages.

Done when the document generates correctly, applies the selected Brand Voice, and each section pulls content from the right Elements in the system.

**2\. Create a Press Release from template**

As a Communications Manager, I create a Press Release using the Inverted Pyramid Story Model so I can share company news with the correct structure and tone.

Done when the Press Release generates successfully, passes Press Release constraints (lede facts, headline limits) defined in the Story Model, includes the latest Boilerplate, and records the exact Element IDs and versions used.

**3\. Update a UNF Element and see impact**

As a Story Owner, I update the Vision Statement in the Unified Narrative Framework so all related Deliverables stay accurate.

Done when the system shows which Templates and Deliverables use that Element and shows an ‘Update available’ alert on affected Templates and Deliverables.

**4\. Enforce Brand Voice**

As a Brand Manager, I update the tone settings and banned terms in the Brand Voice so all new   
Deliverables stay on-brand.

Done when the system automatically applies the new tone to outputs and blocks (or flags) any off-brand language.

**5\. Test a different Story Model**

As a Content Creator, I switch a Deliverable from the PAS Story Model to the Inverted Pyramid model to see which structure fits better.

Done when the sections reflow to the new model and re-check required content and the system checks that all required content is still in place.

# **PARTS SUMMARY**

## 1\. Unified Narrative Framework (UNF)

**What it is**

The UNF is the centralized content framework that stores all reusable story components—called Elements—organized within Layers. It is the single source of truth for every piece of narrative data used across the system. Layers define categories of information (e.g., Category, Vision, Messaging). Elements hold the actual text or structured story fragments that populate Deliverables. Optional Groups may cluster related Elements for user clarity but are not required for logic.

**Role in the system**

The UNF feeds every Deliverable with approved, version-controlled story content. It ensures consistency, traceability, and governance across all communications by allowing multiple Deliverables to reuse the same Elements while maintaining historical version links. It underpins change propagation, letting the system alert users whenever source story data updates.

**Core data it manages:**

* Layers (e.g., Category, Vision, Messaging)  
* Elements (Problem, Vision Statement, Key Messages, etc.)  
* Element versions and statuses  
* Revision history and provenance  
* Optional metadata for grouping and authorship

## 2\. Brand Voice (Filter)

**What it is**

Brand Voice is a modular, selectable filter that controls how story content is expressed. It defines tonal and stylistic parameters such as personality traits, formality, phrasing rules, and preferred vocabulary. It standardizes written communication across all Deliverables without modifying the meaning of underlying story content.

**Role in the system**

At render time, Brand Voice applies tone, style, and lexicon rules to the compiled content from the UNF. It enforces consistency and readability while blocking disallowed language or off-brand tone. Because it is modular and versioned, multiple voices or evolutions of the same voice can be applied to different Deliverables or time periods. Render time \= the moment StoryOS generates the final output; source Elements remain unchanged.

**Core data it manages:**

* Personality traits and tonal sliders  
* Style rules (sentence length, POV, formality)  
* Lexicon (required and banned terms)  
* Readability range (target complexity level)  
* Compliance logs and voice versions

## 3\. Story Models (Filter)

**What it is**

Story Models are narrative blueprints that define how story content should be structured. Each model specifies a logical sequence of sections—such as Problem, Solution, or Lede—and the intent behind each one. Models enforce storytelling logic rather than style or wording.

**Role in the system**

Story Models guide how UNF Elements are arranged and validated within Deliverables. They ensure that different content types (e.g., a Manifesto vs. a Press Release) follow coherent narrative arcs. They can be swapped or extended without altering the underlying data, making storytelling flexible and consistent across outputs.

**Core data it manages:**

* Model identifiers and names  
* Section definitions and order  
* Section intent and narrative rules  
* Validation and completeness constraints  
* Compatibility metadata for Templates

## 4\. Deliverable Templates

**What it is**

Deliverable Templates are reusable blueprints that describe how specific content types (like a Press Release or Brand Manifesto) are assembled. Each template connects the Story Model structure to actual Elements from the UNF, applies Brand Voice defaults, and sets validation rules for completeness and format.

**Role in the system**

Templates ensure every Deliverable follows consistent logic, tone, and data sourcing. They manage how each section is filled, what Elements it draws from, and which Voice rules apply. By versioning Templates separately from Deliverables, the system allows structure and governance to evolve without breaking existing outputs.

**Core data it manages:**

* Template version and ID  
* Story Model reference  
* Element-to-section bindings  
* Validation and governance rules  
* Brand Voice defaults and overrides

## 5\. Deliverables

**What it is**

Deliverables are the actual, time-specific outputs created from Templates—such as a finished Press Release or Brand Manifesto. They assemble content from approved Elements, apply Voice filters, and record the exact versions used to ensure reproducibility and auditability.

**Role in the system**

Deliverables operationalize the entire system. They prove that the framework works by combining structure (Model), content (UNF), and expression (Voice) into finalized, version-locked outputs. Each Deliverable serves as a historical snapshot that can be regenerated or updated when source data changes.

**Core data it manages:**

* Deliverable ID, status, and revision history  
* Referenced Template and Voice versions  
* Linked Element IDs and versions  
* Validation and approval logs  
* Final rendered artifacts and metadata

# **GLOSSARY**

**Layer**  
Top-level container within the Unified Narrative Framework (UNF) that organizes related story Elements by type or purpose (e.g., Category, Vision, Messaging).

**Group**  
Optional visual or descriptive label used to cluster related Elements within a Layer for authoring clarity. Not a functional or database entity.

**Element**  
The smallest unit of narrative content in the UNF. Each Element contains structured story data (e.g., Vision Statement, Key Message) and is versioned for traceability.

**Story Model**  
A predefined narrative structure that determines how story sections are ordered and what each section is meant to achieve (e.g., Problem → Solution → Proof).

**Constraint**  
A rule inside a Story Model that ensures each section is complete and logically consistent before output (e.g., Lede must include who, what, when, where, why).

**Deliverable Template**  
A reusable blueprint that combines a Story Model’s structure with specific UNF Element bindings, validation rules, and default Brand Voice settings.

**Section Binding**  
A defined link between a section in a Deliverable Template and one or more Elements in the UNF, instructing the system where to pull content from.

**Deliverable**  
A single, time-stamped instance generated from a Deliverable Template. It combines content (Elements), structure (Story Model), and tone (Brand Voice) into a finalized output.

**Brand Voice**  
A configurable expression filter that controls tone, style, and vocabulary for Deliverables. Multiple voices can exist for parent brands, sub-brands, or regions.

**Voice Version**  
A specific saved configuration of a Brand Voice. Used to reproduce or audit how a Deliverable sounded at a given time.

**Inheritance (Brand Voice)**  
A relationship allowing sub-brand or regional voices to inherit the parent voice’s attributes while overriding selected rules or lexicon items.

**Render / Render Time**  
The process of generating a finalized, viewable Deliverable. At render time, the Brand Voice is applied, formatting is finalized, and provenance is recorded.

**Provenance**  
The recorded history of where every part of a Deliverable came from—its source Elements, Template version, Story Model, and Brand Voice used at render.

**Validation**  
The automated process that checks whether all required content, constraints, and compliance rules are satisfied before a Deliverable can be approved or rendered.

**Version Locking**  
The mechanism that preserves the exact versions of Elements, Templates, and Voice configurations used in a Deliverable so it can be reproduced later without change.

**Governance**  
The workflow and permissions structure that controls who can create, edit, approve, and publish StoryOS components and Deliverables.

**Impact Alert**  
A system notification that signals when a source Element, Template, or Brand Voice has been updated and a Deliverable may need review or refresh.
