Industries everywhere are transforming faster than ever before, driven by automation, digitalisation, and the pressure to operate more responsibly. The boundaries between physical and digital realities are blurring as technologies like AI, robotics, and Digital Twins redefine how work gets done.

**Content:**  
Today’s industries must balance growth with responsibility. They need to deliver higher efficiency, quality, and safety while reducing waste and carbon impact. Despite rapid advances in technology, many organisations still struggle to connect their data and use it to drive real-world outcomes. Data often sits in silos, and digital tools are underutilised. The result is a widening gap between what companies know and what they can act on—a gap that limits progress toward a more responsible future.

## **3: Story Models (Filter)**

## 

#### Story Model ID: storymodel-pas-v1-0

**Title:** PAS Story Model  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Approved  
**Last Modified:** 2025-10-17

**Structure:**

1. **Problem** – Define the central industry or customer challenge.  
2. **Agitate** – Illustrate the urgency or consequences of the problem.  
3. **Solve** – Present the brand’s solution, vision, or approach that resolves it.

**Purpose:**  
The PAS (Problem–Agitate–Solve) model provides a simple, persuasive narrative structure for building clarity and emotional momentum. It starts with what’s wrong, heightens why it matters, and ends with how Hexagon uniquely solves it. This model is ideal for Manifestos, one-page narratives, and purpose-driven communications.

**Constraints:**

- **Problem section:** Must not exceed 120 words.  
- **Agitate section:** Must reference at least one Element from *Category.Megatrends*.  
- **Solve section:** Must include the *Vision Statement* Element.  
- **All sections:** Require non-empty text fields before validation passes.

NOTES ABOUT THIS DATA (NOT PART OF DUMMY DATA)

Validation logic for this model should confirm that each section is filled in correctly before the Deliverable can render. Specifically:

* Check that the Problem section stays under 120 words.  
* Look for at least one keyword from the Megatrends list (like “automation” or “digitalisation”) in the Agitate section.  
* Make sure the Solve section includes the Vision Statement Element.  
* If any of these checks fail, the Deliverable should not pass validation.

3. **Key Facts** – Provide concise details, proof points, or supporting data.  
4. **Quote 1** – Add credibility through an executive or internal voice.  
5. **Quote 2** – Reinforce impact through an external or customer perspective.  
6. **Boilerplate** – End with the approved company description.

**Purpose:**  
The Inverted Pyramid model delivers information in descending order of importance, ideal for media-facing content like press releases. It ensures that key facts appear first, followed by supporting context and quotations, ending with standard company information.

**Constraints:**

- **Headline:** Must be 10 words or fewer and include at least one action verb.  
- **Lede:** Must contain identifiable *who, what, when, where, and why* fields.  
- **Key Facts:** Must list at least three Key Messages from *Messaging.Key Messages*.

## **Instance Field Data (Deliverable Metadata Fixtures)**

## 

#### Press Release

**who:** Hexagon AB  
**what:** Announces the launch of its next-generation measurement platform, HxGN Precision One.  
**when:** 2025-10-17  
**where:** Stockholm, Sweden  
**why:** To help manufacturers increase precision, reduce waste, and move closer to fully autonomous production.

**Quote 1 Attribution:**  
Speaker Name: Maria Olsson  
Speaker Title: Chief Technology Officer, Hexagon AB

**Quote 2 Attribution:**  
Speaker Name: Alex Grant  
Speaker Title: Plant Director, Orion Manufacturing (Customer Partner)

NOTES ABOUT THIS DATA (NOT PART OF DUMMY DATA)

These values represent the temporary, instance-specific metadata required by the **Press Release Deliverable Template**.

They are not stored in the Unified Narrative Framework (UNF).

Instead, they are collected at the Deliverable level to satisfy section constraints such as:

- The “Lede” section, which must include *who, what, when, where, and why*.  
- The “Quote 1” and “Quote 2” sections, which require a name and title for each speaker.

Use these fixtures to test:

- That instance fields are captured before rendering.  
- That the system can merge this data into the correct sections.  
- That Deliverables fail validation if any required instance fields are missing.

## **Workflow Test Sequences**

**These workflow test sequences are designed to verify that the prototype functions correctly across all core components. They will simulate realistic user actions and show what the system should do in response.**

Use these as **end-to-end test cases** to confirm that data connections, validation rules, and update alerts work as intended once the prototype is operational.

#### Test Sequence 1: Generate Deliverables using Corporate Voice v1.0

**Objective:** Confirm that both Deliverable Templates can generate correctly using the default Brand Voice.

**Steps:**

1. Create a Brand Manifesto Deliverable using the PAS Story Model and Corporate Voice v1.0.  
2. Create a Press Release Deliverable using the Inverted Pyramid Story Model and Corporate Voice v1.0.  
3. Fill in all required Instance Fields (who, what, when, where, why, quote attributions).  
4. Render both Deliverables.

**Expected Results:**

- Both Deliverables generate successfully.  
- Brand Voice rules apply without errors.  
- Validation logs show all required sections complete.

#### Test Sequence 2: Switch Press Release to Product Voice v1.0

**Objective:** Verify that multiple Brand Voices can be selected and applied correctly.

**Steps:**

1. Open the previously created Press Release Deliverable.  
2. Switch the Brand Voice from Corporate Voice v1.0 to Product Voice v1.0.  
3. Re-render the Deliverable.

**Expected Results:**

- Tone and terminology change to reflect Product Voice rules.  
- Compliance log identifies applied Voice ID and version.  
- Original Deliverable version remains locked for reproducibility.

#### Test Sequence 3: Update Boilerplate to v1.1 (Approved)

**Objective:** Validate “Update Available” alerts and refresh behavior.

**Steps:**

1. Approve the updated **Messaging.Boilerplate v1.1** in the UNF.  
2. Open the existing Press Release Deliverable.

**Expected Results:**

- System flags the Deliverable with an **“Update Available”** alert.  
- Selecting **Refresh** pulls the new Boilerplate version and revalidates successfully.  
- Selecting **Defer** retains the old version and marks the Deliverable as “using older data.”

#### Test Sequence 4: Edit Vision Statement to v1.1 (Draft)

**Objective:** Test alert behavior for dependent Deliverables when a linked Element is edited but not approved.

**Steps:**

1. Save an updated **Vision Statement v1.1** as Draft in the UNF.  
2. View both the Brand Manifesto and Press Release Deliverables.

**Expected Results:**

- Both Deliverables show an “Update Pending” notification.  
- System blocks refresh until the Vision Statement is Approved.  
- Once Approved, Refresh updates both Deliverables and passes validation.

#### Test Sequence 5: Swap Story Model in Manifesto (PAS → Inverted Pyramid)

**Objective:** Verify reflow logic and revalidation when Story Model changes.

**Steps:**

1. Open the Brand Manifesto Deliverable.  
2. Change Story Model from PAS to Inverted Pyramid

**Expected Results:**

- Sections reflow to match the new Story Model structure.  
- System flags missing content for required sections (Headline, Quotes, Boilerplate).  
- Deliverable fails validation until new sections are filled.  
- Once complete, render succeeds and provenance logs record the new Story Model ID.

#### Test Sequence 6: End-to-End Provenance Check

**Objective:** Confirm that provenance tracking works across all changes.

**Steps:**

1. Open any Deliverable and review its provenance record.

**Expected Results:**

- Record lists all Element IDs and versions used.  
- Includes Deliverable Template version, Brand Voice ID/version, Story Model ID/version, and any Instance Fields entered.  
- History shows all prior revisions and render timestamps.
